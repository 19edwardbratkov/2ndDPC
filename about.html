<p> Diversified Plastics Corporation lives up to its name by molding a diversity of plastics from expandable foam polymers to injection molded engineering grade hard plastics. </p>
<p> Founded in Nixa, Missouri in early 1969, DPC began in an abandoned cheese factory. </p>
<p> In 1972, DPC moved into injection molding and in 1973 built a new facility in Nixa. In 1976 it constructed a second molding facility near Centralia, Missouri and that same year won a Gold Award for Excellence in packaging design and service from the Society of Plastics Industry. </p>
<p> DPC expanded into proprietary molding in 1977 with its Diversa-Shield exterior insulation sheeting. In 1982, DPC partnered with Huntsman and General Electric to develop a new heat-resistant co-polymer for use in molding interior components for the automotive industry. By 1983 they were molding the first part from this revolutionary new material the Chevrolet Corvette dashboard. </p>
<p> DPC stepped into another arena in 1986 holding lost foam patterns for the foundry industry. They quickly became one of the foremost molders of close-tolerance foam patterns. </p>
<p> In 1987, DPC became the first molder in the world certified to mold parts using General Electric's new GECET material. AT&T certified DPC as a Vendor Partner in 1989. In 1992 DPC s injection molding division was named a Certified Supplier for General Electric. That same year, DPC earned Ford Motor Companyâ€™s highest quality award in the Q1 rating. In 2006, DPC became ISO14001 certified. In 2007 DPC became ISO/TS16949 certified. </p>
<p> In 2002, DPC began a new venture by molding IFCs Insulated Concrete Forms for the construction business. </p>
<p> Since its humble beginnings, Diversified Plastics has grown into a leader in the plastics industry in the field of innovations, quality molding, setting standards for service and timeliness, and in developing cutting edge technology. </p>
